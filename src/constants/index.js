      "Dear all,",
      "It brings me enormous joy to be given the chance to speak about PICT CSI Student Branch (PCSB). PCSB has always encouraged its students to learn their way through various tech and non-tech domains. Time and again, PCSB has proved to be a platform for students to upskill themselves and exhibit their talents. I wish to thank every single member of PCSB for their consistent and unparalleled efforts towards the growth of our club as a whole.",
      "It is a huge pleasure to serve PCSB as Student Branch Coordinator for 4 years. It has been an extraordinary experience to watch PCSB grow from a team of 4 members to a family of 450+ members. PCSB has always proved to be a wonderful platform for students to ensure that their hunger for learning is never extinguished and keep up-to-date information regarding the newer state of the art technologies. Various technical events are conducted by the enthusiastic members of PCSB like our annual event XENIA, SIGs, CP, ML competitions and many more which are applauded by the students, teachers and industry experts alike.",
      "From the bottom of my heart, I thank Mr R. S. Kothavale, Managing Trustee, SCTR; Mr Swastik Sirsikar, Secretary, SCTR; Dr P. T. Kulkarni, Director, PICT, Dr. R. Sreemathy, Principal, PICT; whose support throughout, has proved to be of paramount importance. PCSB has reached newer and greater heights this year, and it has only been possible because of the energetic participation and the efforts put in by the students towards their craft.",
      "I would like to end my note here, by wishing every PCSB member all the best and by saying that ‘may the best of your today be the worst of your tomorrow’.",
